# Shodan Project : NYUAD Cyberwarfare Class

This is a class project where we were tasked to analyze devices on Shodan and submit a report on what we found, the ethics of Shodan, and possible attack vectors.

I chose to analyze the U.S. Military and DoD subnets which are indexed by Shodan. No scans were performed by me on these subnets (for obvious reasons) and only the existing Shodan data was used to create my report.
